      <h2>Brief Description</h2>
      <p>The evolution towards Industry 5.0 is driven by intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative industrial systems. At the core of this transformation lies the challe nge of enabling seamless collaboration not just within a single factory but across entire multi-enterprise ecosystems. This requires moving beyond siloed platforms towards open, service-oriented architectures.</p>
      <p>This workshop focuses on the critical role of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) in realizing industrial-scale intelligence and collaboration. We aim to explore the foundational models, methods, and technologies for building dynamic and trustworthy industrial service ecosystems. We invite high-quality contributions in areas including, but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service-Oriented Models for Enterprise Collaboration:</strong> Modeling, choreography, and orchestration of cross-organizational business processes and value chains.</li>
        <li><strong>Trusted Data Sharing Services:</strong> Architectures and governance for Data-as-a-Service (DaaS), data sov-ereignty, and secure data sharing in industrial ecosystems.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligent Agents in Industry:</strong> Design and application of intelligent agents-as-a-service for negotia-tion, planning, and autonomous asset management.</li>
        <li><strong>Service-Based Digital Twins:</strong> Methods for creating and synchronizing digital twins with physical as-sets and processes through service interfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge-Cloud Service Computing:</strong> Orchestration and management of services across the edge-cloud continuum for real-time industrial applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Service Ecosystems:</strong> Frameworks for the discovery, composition, and evolution of services in collaborative manufacturing networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop Service Systems:</strong> Integrating human expertise and decision-making into auto-mated industrial service workflows.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This workshop will provide a premier forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the next genera-tion of industrial systems, framed through the lens of service-oriented computing.</p>
      <p>This workshop is highly relevant to ICSOC as it directly applies core service computing principles to the demanding domain of industrial collaboration. The selected topics address the full service lifecycle, from the service-oriented modeling of cross-enterprise business processes to the composition and orchestration of services across the edge-cloud continuum.</p>
      <p>Concepts like Trusted Data Sharing as Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) and Service-Based Digital Twins explore advanced service engineering for complex cyber-physical systems. Furthermore, by including Intelligent Agents as a Service and Human-in-the-Loop systems, the workshop bridges traditional service computing with modern AI-driven and socio-technical challenges. It provides a focused forum to advance the theory and practice of service engineering for creating resilient, intelligent, and collaborative industrial service ecosys-tems, a key frontier for the ICSOC community.</p>
